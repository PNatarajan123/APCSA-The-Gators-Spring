# APCSA-The-Gators-Spring
By Pranav, Aryan, Praveen and Neil


### Running our project
In order to run our project, first pull the APCSA-The-Gators-Spring Repo into IntelliJ through a remote. This project uses JDK 15. In order to run the project, run the DemoApplication.java file, and this is located in src>main>java>com.example.demo>DemoApplication.

Once the project is done building, you can view the rendering through any browser. Since this project uses SpringBoot, it ports to por 8080. Typing in localhost:8080 in any broswer will let you see the physical rendering of the project.

Currently, this doesn't reflect the actual Gators Project. This is just random code found online and used to practice deployment. Because this project uses both HTML and CSS, this project also allowed us to learn how to integrate the two together.

### Week of 2/1
Everyone in our Scrum Team was able to install VMWare and run a virtual machine. We all also have IntelliJ Ultimate installed in those VMs and were able to pull the repo and run the Travel Webpage.

[Made JAR File](https://github.com/aryan114/APCSA-The-Gators-Spring/issues/15): We were successfully able to use Maven to create a JAR file. We will be using this JAR file to deploy our project.

[Install IntelliJ Ultimate on VM](https://github.com/aryan114/APCSA-The-Gators-Spring/issues/10): All of us were able to install VMWare and a windows or ubuntu VM where we were able to install IntelliJ Ultimate. We were then able to push the code to the repo through our VMs.
