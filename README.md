# APCSA-The-Gators-Spring
By Pranav, Aryan, Praveen and Neil


### Running our project
In order to run our project, first pull the APCSA-The-Gators-Spring Repo into IntelliJ through a remote. This project uses JDK 15. In order to run the project, run the DemoApplication.java file, and this is located in src>main>java>com.example.demo>DemoApplication.

Once the project is done building, you can view the rendering through any browser. Since this project uses SpringBoot, it ports to por 8080. Typing in localhost:8080 in any broswer will let you see the physical rendering of the project.

Currently, this doesn't reflect the actual Gators Project. This is just random code found online and used to practice deployment. Because this project uses both HTML and CSS, this project also allowed us to learn how to integrate the two together.
